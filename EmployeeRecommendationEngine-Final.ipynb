       "3630  I am an experienced Highway Engineer with a demonstrated history of working in the civil engineering industry. I am skilled in Highway Design, Highways, Transportation Planning, Earthworks, and Steel Structures.I am a strong program and project management professional with a Master of Science focused in Highway and Bridges from Byelorussian Polytechnic Institute. I have a very extensive experience of design, construction, maintenance and overall management of roads and bridges. My special interests include optimization of road alignments, road network management, 3-d road alignment design, use of different types of curves (Clothoid, Bezier curves, B-splines, cubic parabola) in highway alignment design, road roughness and implementation of mathematical tools and theories in road engineering. It may not be surprising, if I am found with my telescope spending several of my free night hours gazing stars and celestial objects with keen interest in classical Indian as well as Western and modern astronomy.Rajendra Raj SharmaManagement of Road Maintenance in Nepal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
